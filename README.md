# andes

Andes is a digital software synthesiser based on Perlin noise. It is still
in early stages of development and doesn't have a lot of features yet.

The core of Andes is an original oscillator which uses a 1-dimensional version of
[Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) to produce sound.

The oscillator design is described in the LAC 2018 paper [Using Perlin noise for sound synthesis](https://lac.linuxaudio.org/2018/pdf/14-paper.pdf). It is not yet finalized, so please keep in mind that
things may break in the future versions. Do not use this plugin in production. :)
